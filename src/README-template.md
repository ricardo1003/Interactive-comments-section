## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Vite.js](https://vite.dev/) - Building tool
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

I learned react on a course I previously saw, but this made me memorize everything and make me learn some tricks about react and how to do everything more efficiently.
I also learned to use TailwindCSS, wich helped me alot when styling the website.

### Continued development

I would like to continue working with react.js, it was really useful and made things easier
